# Wordle Game

## Description

This project is a recreation of New York Times' Worldle game with added settings were the player can choose the number of letters to guess. 
The goal of this project was to have fun creating a game I already enjoyed as well as try out the Tkinter Library in Python. 
This was my first time using Tkinter, and I learned a lot about the widget system and creating a GUI. 
As a bonus, I tried out Openpyxl to generate an excel sheet for the game's word list. 

## Installation

In order for the game to be able to choose the solution word, users must have Openpyxl installed. This can be done by: 


```sh
pip install openpyxl
```

To play the game, install Tkinter as well, then run the App.py file. 
Installing Tkinter can be done through: 

```sh
pip install tk
```

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
